# 🏗️ Tech Architect Journal – by Manoj Dhobale

A curated journal of real-world learnings, strategic decisions, and cloud-native best practices from my work as a Solution Architect and DevOps/FinOps leader.

This repository documents architecture patterns, tooling tips, CI/CD insights, disaster recovery playbooks, tagging standards, and DevSecOps strategies — all based on real enterprise projects.
